# Pixel Cloud

Pixel Cloud is a passion project inspired by http://www.pointcloud.garden/

In an attempt to create similar visuals, Pixel Cloud attempts to recreate the mesmerizing experience of viewing natural and artificial objects as Point Cloud data. 

Opposed to using actual pointcloud files, instead the usage of the Pixel Shader (threejs) has provided an alternative/experimental way to display the 3D models.

Thank you Chelsea Thompto for the assistance with the code and https://threejs.org/ for their resources, docs, and examples.
